# Description

In this repository, you can find both files and requested automation programs our CSU-based bioinformatics team has created. At the moment, I am the only one to have created a script which solves the first of Budweiser's consulting requests, however this repository will be updated as more solutions are made.

Additionally, we have only tackled one problem (the Data Conversion and the Preparation of a Purity Report for the given data problem) of the two given to us by Budweiser, this will be updated as we figure out the second one.

You can also find the provided files given for these problems.

If you've found your own solution to one of the Budweiser problems, or otherwise have code you'd like to contribute to this repository, please create a folder for your username as I have and place it there. 

Thanks!
