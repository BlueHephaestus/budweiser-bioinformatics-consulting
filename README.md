In this repository, you can find both files and requested automation programs our CSU-based bioinformatics team has created. At the moment, I am the only one to have created a script which solves the first of Budweiser's consulting requests, however this repository will be updated as more solutions are made.

Additionally, we have only tackled one of the two problems given to us by Budweiser, this will be updated as we figure out the second one.

You can also find the provided files given for these problems.
