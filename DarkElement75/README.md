# Description

My solution to the first Budweiser problem: Data Conversion and the Preparation of a Purity Report for the given data. 

This is incomplete, and will be updated as we obtain both the descriptions and data to complete it.

You can run either `python3 generate_report.py` or run all cells in the `generate_report.ipynb` to get the same output - both produce the `automated_report.csv` and `automated_supplemental_data.csv` files given the single input `GenoResults.csv` file.

It may also be updated as errors are found or instructions are updated.

Good luck, have fun,
